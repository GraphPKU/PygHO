PyTorch Geometric High Order Documentation
========================================

PyTorch Geometric High Order (PyGHO) is a high order graph neural network (HOGNN) extension library for `PyTorch Geometric <https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/>`_.  Unlike ordinary GNNs producing node representations, HOGNNs produce representations for node tuples. PyGHO is the first unified library for HOGNNs.
